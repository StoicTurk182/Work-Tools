Create a file called sudo.bat (you can replace sudo with any name you want) with following content 
powershell.exe -Command "Start-Process cmd \"/k cd /d %cd%\" -Verb RunAs"
Move sudo.bat to a folder in your PATH; if you don't know what that means, just move these files to c:\windows\
Now sudo will work in Run dialog (win+r) or in explorer address bar (this is the best part :))

Method 2: WITH a 3rd party program
Download NirCmd and unzip it.
Create a file called sudo.bat (you can replace sudo with any name you want) with following content 
nircmdc elevate cmd /k "cd /d %cd%"
Move nircmdc.exe and sudo.bat to a folder in your PATH; if you don't know what that means, just move these files to c:\windows\
Now sudo will work in Run dialog (win+r) or in explorer address bar (this is the best part :))


Steps to List and Add Capabilities
List Available Capabilities

To view all the capabilities that you can add to your system, you can use the following DISM command:

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Get-Capabilities
This command will provide a list of capabilities currently available for your system, including their full names and descriptions. The output will show detailed information about each capability.

Filter and Select Capabilities

If you want to see only a specific capability or filter the list, you can redirect the output to a file and then search through it. For example:

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Get-Capabilities > capabilities.txt
Open capabilities.txt in a text editor to review the list. Look for the capability you want to add.

Add a Capability

Once you've identified the capability you want to add from the list, you can use the following DISM command to add it:

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:<CapabilityName>
Replace <CapabilityName> with the full name of the capability you want to add. For example:

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux~~~~0.0.1.0
Example Capabilities
Here are some examples of common capabilities that you might add:

Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux: Adds the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Microsoft-Windows-OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0: Adds the OpenSSH Server feature.
Microsoft-Windows-Remote-Desktop-Client-Package31bf3856ad364e35amd64~~.0.0.1.0: Adds the Remote Desktop Client.
Example Commands
List All Capabilities

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Get-Capabilities
Add a Specific Capability

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux~~~~0.0.1.0
Check the Status of Capabilities

To check the status of capabilities already added or to verify if a specific capability is installed, use:

shell
Copy code
DISM /Online /Get-CapabilityInfo /CapabilityName:<CapabilityName>
Summary
Query Available Capabilities: Use DISM /Online /Get-Capabilities to list all available capabilities.
Choose Capability: Review the capabilities in the output.
Add Capability: Use DISM /Online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:<CapabilityName> to add the desired capability.
By following these steps, you can effectively manage and add capabilities to your Windows installation using DISM.
