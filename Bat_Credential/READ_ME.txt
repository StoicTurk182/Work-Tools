Initialization

The script sets the directory of the batch script using %~dp0.
It defines the paths to a PowerShell script (GetAndStoreCredentials.ps1) and a credentials file (encrypted_credentials.xml) in the same directory.
Running the PowerShell script

The script runs the PowerShell script with the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag to bypass any execution policy restrictions.
The PowerShell script is expected to store the credentials in the encrypted_credentials.xml file.
Checking for credentials file

The script checks if the credentials file exists. If it doesn't, it exits with an error code.
Retrieving credentials

The script uses PowerShell to import the credentials from the XML file using Import-Clixml.
It extracts the username and password from the credentials using XML parsing.
Debugging

The script has commented-out lines that can be uncommented to display the extracted username and password values.
Running the command with elevated privileges

The script creates a temporary PowerShell script (RunElevatedCommand.ps1) that:
Sets the username and password variables.
Converts the password to a secure string.
Creates a new PSCredential object using the username and password.
Runs the command (your_command_here) using Start-Process with the credentials and elevated privileges.
The script executes the temporary PowerShell script with elevated privileges using powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.
Cleanup

The script deletes the temporary PowerShell script and the credentials file.
Final message

The script displays a "Done." message.
To run this script, simply execute it in the Command Prompt or double-click on the batch file. Make sure to replace your_command_here with the actual command you want to run with elevated privileges.
